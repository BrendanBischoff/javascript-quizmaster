# javascript-quizmaster
This is a short quiz that is timed and has a point system that also adds or subtracts time dependent on answers. This project was created with Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

Highscores are then stored for retrieval upon request (button click). You can also clear highscores and start from 0.
